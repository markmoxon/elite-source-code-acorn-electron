# BASIC programs for the Electron version of Elite

This folder contains the BASIC programs from the original game disc for the Electron version of Elite on Ian Bell's personal website.

* [$.ELITE-cassette.bin]($.ELITE-cassette.bin) is the "mode 7" loader program for the cassette version, which includes a blank window for showing loading progress

* [$.ELITE-disc.bin]($.ELITE-disc.bin) is the "mode 7" loader program for the disc version, which doesn't include a blank window

By default the disc version is included in the build, but this can be changed in the [elite-disc.asm](../main-sources/elite-disc.asm) source file.

Right on, Commanders!
