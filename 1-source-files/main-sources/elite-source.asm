                        \ continues (so the first tick of the hyperspace counter
                        \ takes 15 iterations to happen, but subsequent ticks
                        \ take 5 iterations each)

                        \
                        \ The counter starts at 32 when an E.C.M. is activated,
                        \ either by us or by an opponent, and it decreases by 1
                        \ in each iteration of the main flight loop until it
                        \ reaches zero, at which point the E.C.M. switches off.
                        \ Only one E.C.M. can be active at any one time, so
                        \ there is only one counter

\ Here we take the current rate of pitch and roll, as set by the keyboard,

\ roll, while the beta angle covers pitch (there is no yaw in this version of
\ Elite). The angles are in radians, which allows us to use the small angle
\ approximation when moving objects in the sky (see the MVEIT routine for more
\ on this). Also, the signs of the two angles are stored separately, in both
\ the sign and the flipped sign, as this makes calculations easier.

\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Scan for flight keys and process the results
\
\ Flight keys are logged in the key logger at location KY1 onwards, with a
\ non-zero value in the relevant location indicating a key press. See the deep
\ dive on "The key logger" for more details.
\
\ The key presses that are processed are as follows:
\
\   * Space and "?" to speed up and slow down
\   * "U", "T" and "M" to disarm, arm and fire missiles
\   * "-" to fire an energy bomb
\   * ESCAPE to launch an escape pod
\   * "J" to initiate an in-system jump
\   * "E" to deploy E.C.M. anti-missile countermeasures
\   * "C" to use the docking computer
\   * "A" to fire lasers

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add the signed delta (A R) to a ship's coordinate, along the axis given in X.
\ Mathematically speaking, this routine translates the ship along a single axis
\ by a signed delta. Taking the example of X = 0, the x-axis, it does the
\ following:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ (In practice, MVT1 is only ever called directly with A = 0 or 128, otherwise
\ it is always called via MVT-2, which clears A apart from the sign bit. The
\ routine is written to cope with a non-zero delta_hi, so it supports a full
\ 16-bit delta, but it appears that delta_hi is only ever used to hold the
\ sign of the delta.)
\
\ The comments below assume we are adding delta to the x-axis, though the axis
\ is determined by the value of X.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   (A R)               The signed delta, so A = delta_hi and R = delta_lo
\
\   X                   Determines which coordinate axis of INWK to change:

\
\                         * X = 3 adds the delta to (y_lo, y_hi, y_sign)

\    Summary: Apply a 3.6 degree pitch or roll to an orientation vector
\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16

\
\                         * If X = 15, rotate roofv_x
\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\                         * If X = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If X = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If X = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y

\
\ Contains the last saved commander data, with the name at NA% and the data at

\
\ This is a quick way of making the stardust field in the new view feel
\ different without having to generate a whole new field. If you look carefully
\ at the stardust field when you switch views, you can just about see that the
\ new field is a reflection of the previous field in the screen diagonal, i.e.
\ in the line from bottom left to top right. This is the line where x = y when
\ the origin is in the middle of the screen, and positive x and y are right and
\ up, which is the coordinate system we use for stardust).

\       Name: STARS6
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the rear view
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is very similar to STARS1, which processes stardust for the front
\ view. The main difference is that the direction of travel is reversed, so the
\ signs in the calculations are different, as well as the order of the first
\ batch of calculations.
\
\ When a stardust particle falls away into the far distance, it is removed from
\ the screen and its memory is recycled as a new particle, positioned randomly
\ along one of the four edges of the screen.
\
\ These are the calculations referred to in the commentary:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. z = z - speed * 64
\   3. y = y + |y_hi| * q
\   4. x = x + |x_hi| * q
\
\   5. y = y + alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x - alpha * y / 256
\
\   7. x = x + 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y - beta * 256
\
\ For more information see the deep dive on "Stardust in the front view".

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This section implements missile tactics and is entered at TA18 from the main
\ entry point below, if the current ship is a missile. Specifically:
\
\   * If E.C.M. is active, destroy the missile
\
\   * If the missile is hostile towards us, then check how close it is. If it
\     hasn't reached us, jump to part 3 so it can streak towards us, otherwise
\     we've been hit, so process a large amount of damage to our ship
\
\   * Otherwise see how close the missile is to its target. If it has not yet
\     reached its target, give the target a chance to activate its E.C.M. if it
\     has one, otherwise jump to TA19 with K3 set to the vector from the target
\     to the missile
\
\   * If it has reached its target and the target is the space station, destroy
\     the missile, potentially damaging us if we are nearby
\
\   * If it has reached its target and the target is a ship, destroy the missile
\     and the ship, potentially damaging us if we are nearby

\  Deep dive: Shift-and-add multiplication
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Do the following multiplication of an unsigned 16-bit number and an unsigned
\ 8-bit number:
\
\   (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * Q
\
\ where ~P means P EOR %11111111 (i.e. P with all its bits flipped). In other
\ words, if you wanted to calculate &1234 * &56, you would:
\
\   * Set A to &12
\   * Set P to &34 EOR %11111111 = &CB
\   * Set Q to &56
\
\ before calling MLTU2.
\
\ This routine is like a mash-up of MU11 and FMLTU. It uses part of FMLTU's
\ inverted argument trick to work out whether or not to do an addition, and like
\ MU11 it sets up a counter in X to extract bits from (P+1 P). But this time we
\ extract 16 bits from (P+1 P), so the result is a 24-bit number. The core of

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following division and remainder:
\
\   P = DELTA / (the Y-th stardust particle's z_hi coordinate)
\
\   R = remainder as a fraction of A, where 1.0 = 255
\
\ Another way of saying the above is this:
\
\   (P R) = 256 * DELTA / z_hi
\
\ DELTA is a value between 1 and 40, and the minimum z_hi is 16 (dust particles
\ are removed at lower values than this), so this means P is between 0 and 2
\ (as 40 / 16 = 2.5, so the maximum result is P = 2 and R = 128.
\
\ This uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm as TIS2, but this time we
\ keep the remainder.

\    Summary: Reduce the value of the pitch or roll dashboard indicator
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Reduce X by A, where X is either the current rate of pitch or the current
\ rate of roll.
\
\ The rate of pitch or roll ranges from 1 to 255 with 128 as the centre point.
\ This is the amount by which the pitch or roll is currently changing, so 1
\ means it is decreasing at the maximum rate, 128 means it is not changing,
\ and 255 means it is increasing at the maximum rate. These values correspond
\ to the line on the DC or RL indicators on the dashboard, with 1 meaning full
\ left, 128 meaning the middle, and 255 meaning full right.
\
\ If reducing X would bring it below 1, then X is set to 1.
\
\ If keyboard auto-recentre is configured and the result is greater than 128, we
\ reduce X down to the mid-point, 128. This is the equivalent of having a roll
\ or pitch in the right half of the indicator, when decreasing the roll or pitch
\ should jump us straight to the mid-point.

\ 0 to 45 degrees (0 to PI / 4 radians).
\
\ The table does not support values of t >= 1 or t < 0 directly, so if we need

\
\ This routine twists the three 16-bit seeds in QQ15 once.
\
\ If we start with seeds s0, s1 and s2 and we want to work out their new values
\ after we perform a twist (let's call the new values s0´, s1´ and s2´), then:
\
\  s0´ = s1
\  s1´ = s2
\  s2´ = s0 + s1 + s2
\
\ So given an existing set of seeds in s0, s1 and s2, we can get the new values
\ s0´, s1´ and s2´ simply by doing the above sums. And if we want to do the
\ above in-place without creating three new s´ variables, then we can do the
\ following:
\
\  tmp = s0 + s1
\  s0 = s1
\  s1 = s2
\  s2 = tmp + s1
\
\ So this is what we do in this routine, where each seed is a 16-bit number.

\ Engage the galactic hyperdrive. Called from the hyp routine above if CTRL-H is

\
\ This routine also updates the galaxy seeds to point to the next galaxy. Using
\ a galactic hyperdrive rotates each seed byte to the left, rolling each byte
\ left within itself like this:
\
\   01234567 -> 12345670
\
\ to get the seeds for the next galaxy. So after 8 galactic jumps, the seeds
\ roll round to those of the first galaxy again.
\
\ We always arrive in a new galaxy at galactic coordinates (96, 96), and then
\ find the nearest system and set that as our location.

\    Summary: Add a new ship to our local bubble of universe
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This creates a new block of ship data in the K% workspace, allocates a new
\ block in the ship line heap at WP, adds the new ship's type into the first
\ empty slot in FRIN, and adds a pointer to the ship data into UNIV. If there
\ isn't enough free memory for the new ship, it isn't added.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The type of the ship to add (see variable XX21 for a
\                       list of ship types)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the ship was successfully added, clear if it
\                       wasn't (as there wasn't enough free memory)
\
\   INF                 Points to the new ship's data block in K%

\    Summary: Remove a ship from our local bubble of universe
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Remove the ship in slot X from our local bubble of universe. This happens
\ when we kill a ship, collide with a ship and destroy it, or when a ship moves
\ outside our local bubble.
\
\ We also use this routine when we move out of range of the space station, in
\ which case we replace it with the placeholder, type 129.
\
\ When removing a ship, this creates a gap in the ship slots at FRIN, so we
\ shuffle all the later slots down to close the gap. We also shuffle the ship
\ data blocks at K% and ship line heap at WP, to reclaim all the memory that
\ the removed ship used to occupy.
\

\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The slot number of the ship to remove

\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the high nibble of the low byte is the flush
\ control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound, and a flush control of
\ 1 makes the sound instantly), while the low nibble of the low byte is the
\ channel number. When written in hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush
\ control, while the second is the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1
\ and channel = 3).
\
\ So when we call NOISE with A = 40 to make a long, low beep, then this is
\ effectively what the NOISE routine does:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 3, and with amplitude &F4
\ (-12), pitch &0C (2) and duration &08 (8). Meanwhile, to make the hyperspace
\ sound, the NOISE routine does this:
\
\   SOUND &10, &02, &60, &10
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 0, using envelope 2,
\ and with pitch &60 (96) and duration &10 (16). The four sound envelopes (1-4)
\ are set up by the loading process.
\
\ The Electron has an additional layer of sound data for each of the game's
\ sounds - priority and minimum duration. Because the Electron only has one
\ tone channel and one noise channel, it prioritises each sound. If a sound
\ is already playing and a sound of a higher priority needs to be made, the new
\ sound will take over; if, however, the new sound is of a lower priority, it
\ gets discarded and doesn't get made.
\
\ This system works alongside the minimum duration value; after the minimum
\ duration, the priority system is ignored, so once a high priority sound has
\ sounded for its minimum duration, then even if that high priority sound is
\ still being made, a lower priority sound can come along and take precedence.
\
\ To put it another way, high priority sounds take control of the sound output
\ and lower priority sounds don't get a look-in, but only for the minimum
\ duration of the higher priority sound.

\    Summary: Process non-flight key presses (FUNC keys, docked keys)
\  Deep dive: Program flow of the main game loop
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This is the second half of the minimal game loop, which we iterate when we are
\ docked. This section covers the following:
\
\   * Process more key presses (FUNC keys, docked keys etc.)
\
\ It also supports joining the main loop with a key already "pressed", so we can
\ jump into the main game loop to perform a specific action. In practice, this
\ is used when we enter the docking bay in BAY to display Status Mode (FUNC-9),
\ and when we finish buying or selling cargo in BAY2 to jump to the Inventory
\ (FUNC-0).

\    Summary: Normalise the three-coordinate vector in K3
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Normalise the vector in K3, which has 16-bit values and separate sign bits,
\ and store the normalised version in XX15 as a signed 8-bit vector.
\
\ A normalised vector (also known as a unit vector) has length 1, so this
\ routine takes an existing vector in K3 and scales it so the length of the
\ new vector is 1. This is used in two places: when drawing the compass, and
\ when applying AI tactics to ships.
\
\ We do this in two stages. This stage shifts the 16-bit vector coordinates in
\ K3 to the left as far as they will go without losing any bits off the end, so
\ we can then take the high bytes and use them as the most accurate 8-bit vector
\ to normalise. Then the next stage (in routine NORM) does the normalisation.

\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K3(2 1 0)           The 16-bit x-coordinate as (x_sign x_hi x_lo), where
\                       x_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(5 4 3)           The 16-bit y-coordinate as (y_sign y_hi y_lo), where
\                       y_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(8 7 6)           The 16-bit z-coordinate as (z_sign z_hi z_lo), where
\                       z_sign is just bit 7
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:

\    Summary: Toggle a configuration setting and emit a beep
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This is called when the game is paused and a key is pressed that changes the
\ game's configuration.
\
\ Specifically, this routine toggles the configuration settings for the
\ following keys:
\
\   * CAPS LOCK toggles keyboard flight damping (&40)
\   * A toggles keyboard auto-recentre (&41)
\   * X toggles author names on start-up screen (&42)
\   * F toggles flashing console bars (&43)
\   * Y toggles reverse joystick Y channel (&44)
\   * J toggles reverse both joystick channels (&45)
\   * K toggles keyboard and joystick (&46)
\
\ The numbers in brackets are the internal key numbers (see p.40 of the Electron
\ Advanced User Guide for a list of internal key numbers). We pass the key that
\ has been pressed in X, and the configuration option to check it against in Y,
\ so this routine is typically called in a loop that loops through the various
\ configuration options.
\
\ Note that the Electron version doesn't support joysticks, but you can still
\ configure them (though this does break the chart views, as they still call the
\ joystick routines that are still present in the Electron's codebase).
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The internal number of the key that's been pressed
\

\                       against, from the list above (i.e. Y must be from &40 to

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
\ making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
\
\ We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
\ vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
\ to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.

\    Summary: Calculate R = 256 * A / Q
\  Deep dive: Shift-and-subtract division
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, where A < Q:
\
\   R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ This is a sister routine to LL61, which does the division when A >= Q.
\
\ If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
\ (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
\
\ The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
\ by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
\
\ This routine uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm that's documented in
\ TIS2, but it leaves the fractional result in the integer range 0-255.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
\                       division was a success
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag
\                       cleared, so this can be called if we know the division
\                       will work
\
\   LL31                Skips the A >= Q check and does not set the R counter,
\                       so this can be used for jumping straight into the
\                       division loop if R is already set to 254 and we know the
\                       division will work

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine clips the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) so it fits on-screen, or
\ returns an error if it can't be clipped to fit. The arguments are 16-bit
\ coordinates, and the clipped line is returned using 8-bit screen coordinates.
\
\ This part sets XX13 to reflect which of the two points are on-screen and
\ off-screen.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:

\   XX15(1 0)           x1 as a 16-bit coordinate (x1_hi x1_lo)

\
\   XX15(5 4)           x2 as a 16-bit coordinate (x2_hi x2_lo)
\
\   XX12(1 0)           y2 as a 16-bit coordinate (y2_hi y2_lo)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
